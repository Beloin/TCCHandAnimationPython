# Animation

We can follow [this](https://rdmilligan.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/blender-animation-in-opengl-mark-ii/) tutorial to create a list of models with the frames of animation. A little bad to be honest, and too inefficient.

To make animation we saved each frame of the animation as a different model and placed in folders.
